/**
 * This module adds in support for receipts. These receipts are a form of acknowledgement of an event. This module defines a single
 * acknowledgement: m.read which indicates that the user has read up to a given event.
 * <br>
 * Sending a receipt for each event can result in sending large amounts of traffic to a homeserver. To prevent this from becoming
 * a problem, receipts are implemented using "up to" markers. This marker indicates that the acknowledgement applies to all events
 * "up to and including" the event specified. For example, marking an event as "read" would indicate that the user had read all
 * events up to the referenced event.
