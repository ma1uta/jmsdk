/**
 * This module provides a means by which clients can exchange signalling messages without them being stored permanently as part of
 * a shared communication history. A message is delivered exactly once to each client device.
 * <br>
 * The primary motivation for this API is exchanging data that is meaningless or undesirable to persist in the room DAG - for example,
 * one-time authentication tokens or key data. It is not intended for conversational data, which should be sent using the normal
 * /rooms/&lt;room_id&gt;/send API for consistency throughout Matrix.
