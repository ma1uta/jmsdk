/**
 * Single Sign-On (SSO) is a generic term which refers to protocols which allow users to log into applications via a single web-based
 * authentication portal. Examples include "Central Authentication Service" (CAS) and SAML.
 * <br>
 * An overview of the process, as used in Matrix, is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The Matrix client instructs the user's browser to navigate to the /login/sso/redirect endpoint on the user's homeserver.</li>
 * <li>The homeserver responds with an HTTP redirect to the CAS user interface, which the browser follows.</li>
 * <li>The SSO system authenticates the user.</li>
 * <li>The SSO server responds to the user's browser with a redirect back to the /login/cas/ticket endpoint on the homeserver,
 * which the browser follows. A 'ticket' identifier is passed as a query parameter in the redirect.</li>
 * <li>The homeserver receives the ticket ID from the user's browser, and makes a request to the SSO server to validate the ticket.</li>
 * <li>Having validated the ticket, the homeserver responds to the browser with a third HTTP redirect, back to the Matrix
 * client application. A login token is passed as a query parameter in the redirect.</li>
 * <li>The Matrix client receives the login token and passes it to the /login API.</li>
 * </ul>
