 * The response also includes a next_batch field, which should be used as the value of the since parameter in the next call to /sync.
 * Finally, the response includes, for each room, a prev_batch field, which can be passed as a start parameter to

     * @param filter      The ID of a filter created using the filter API or a filter JSON object encoded as a string. The server will
     *                    detect whether it is an ID or a JSON object by whether the first character is a "{" open brace. Passing the
     *                    JSON inline is best suited to one off requests. Creating a filter using the filter API is recommended for
     *                    clients that reuse the same filter multiple times, for example in long poll requests.
     * @param since       A point in time to continue a sync from.
     * @param fullState   Controls whether to include the full state for all rooms the user is a member of.
     *                    <br>
     *                    If this is set to true, then all state events will be returned, even if since is non-empty.
     *                    The timeline will still be limited by the since parameter. In this case, the timeout parameter will be ignored
     *                    and the query will return immediately, possibly with an empty timeline.
     *                    <br>

     *                    By default, this is false.
     * @param setPresence Controls whether the client is automatically marked as online by polling this API. If this parameter is
     *                    omitted then the client is automatically marked as online when it uses this API. Otherwise if the parameter
     *                    is set to "offline" then the client is not marked as being online when it uses this API. One of: ["offline"]
     * @param timeout     The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, before returning this request. If no events (or other data) become
     *                    available before this time elapses, the server will return a response with empty fields.
