/**
 * When a client receives an m.typing event, it MUST use the user ID list to REPLACE its knowledge of every user who is currently
 * typing. The reason for this is that the server does not remember users who are not currently typing as that list gets big quickly.
 * The client should mark as not typing any user ID who is not in that list.
 * <br>
 * It is recommended that clients store a boolean indicating whether the user is typing or not. Whilst this value is true a timer
 * should fire periodically every N seconds to send a typing HTTP request. The value of N is recommended to be no more than 20-30 seconds.
 * This request should be re-sent by the client to continue informing the server the user is still typing. As subsequent requests
 * will replace older requests, a safety margin of 5 seconds before the expected timeout runs out is recommended. When the user
 * stops typing, the state change of the boolean to false should trigger another HTTP request to inform the server that the user has
 * stopped typing.
