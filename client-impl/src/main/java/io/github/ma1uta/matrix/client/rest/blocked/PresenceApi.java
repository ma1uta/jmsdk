/**
 * Each user has the concept of presence information. This encodes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Whether the user is currently online</li>
 * <li>How recently the user was last active (as seen by the server)</li>
 * <li>Whether a given client considers the user to be currently idle</li>
 * <li>Arbitrary information about the user's current status (e.g. "in a meeting").</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * This information is collated from both per-device (online, idle, last_active) and per-user (status) data, aggregated
 * by the user's homeserver and transmitted as an m.presence event. This is one of the few events which are sent outside
 * the context of a room. PresenceContent events are sent to all users who subscribe to this user's presence through a presence
 * list or by sharing membership of a room.
 * <br>
 * A presence list is a list of user IDs whose presence the user wants to follow. To be added to this list, the user being
 * added must be invited by the list owner who must accept the invitation.
 * <br>
 * User's presence state is represented by the presence key, which is an enum of one of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>online : The default state when the user is connected to an event stream.</li>
 * <li>unavailable : The user is not reachable at this time e.g. they are idle.</li>
 * <li>offline : The user is not connected to an event stream or is explicitly suppressing their profile information from being sent.</li>
 * </ul>
